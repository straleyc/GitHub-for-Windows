Instructions for using GitHub for Windows

I wrote these instructions for ME so I would remember how to use this god-awful program.  If anyone reading these instructions has philosophical issues with them or anything I've written, write your own instructions and keep your opinions to yourself.  These are BY a non-programmer newb FOR other non-programmer newbs because all the tutorials I've read assume FAR too much for us non-programmers.  

If anyone has suggestions for revisions to make these instructions clearer, by all means, make those suggestions and I'll consider them.  I wrote these late at night after spending about 10 hours over 2 days trying to figure out how to use GitHub.  I suspect there may be some necessary corrections. 

I hope these will help some poor soul like me avoid some of the pain I went through trying to learn GitHub. 

Thanks.
