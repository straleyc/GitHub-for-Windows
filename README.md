Instructions for using GitHub for Windows

I wrote these instructions for ME so I would remember how to use this god-awful program.  If anyone reading these instructions has philosophical issues with them or anything I've written, write your own instructions and keep your opinions to yourself.  These are BY a non-programmer newb FOR other non-programmer newbs because all the tutorials I've read assume FAR too much for us non-programmers.  

If anyone has suggestions for revisions to make these instructions clearer, by all means, make those suggestions and I'll consider them.  I wrote these late at night after spending about 10 hours over 2 days trying to figure out how to use GitHub.  I suspect there may be some necessary corrections. 

I hope these will help some poor soul like me avoid some of the pain I went through trying to learn GitHub. 

Thanks. 

Addendum: 

To make the file wrap in GitHub, click on the text file name, click the pencil icon to edit; select soft wrap from the Line Wrap Mode drop down menu in the upper right corner.  If anyone knows how to make the raw file wrap, that would be nice to know.  I don't get an active "Commit changes" icon when just choosing "soft wrap".  I assume that's by design in the viewing window, but it doesn't make reading the file easy.
